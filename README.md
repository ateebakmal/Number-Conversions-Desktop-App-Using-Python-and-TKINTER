# Number-Conversions-Desktop-App-Using-Python-and-TKINTER
### Author - Ateeb Akmal

### Descyption:
This is a desktop app for number conversions using `Python`
<br> Used libraries are:
* tkinter
* numbersystem

#### This is a simple app with simple code and interface because TKINTER isn't that good in making UI for desktops but if you have a small project that requires simple buttons, labels and widgets you can use this library. You can use the code to add some new things in it. Such as converting numbers into different bases.
