# Number-Conversions-Desktop-App-Using-Python-and-TKINTER
### Author - Ateeb Akmal

### Descyption:
This is a desktop app for number conversions using `Python`
<br> Used libraries are:
* tkinter
* numbersystem

#### This is a simple app with simple code and interface because TKINTER isn't that good in making UI for desktops but if you have a small project that requires simple buttons, labels and widgets you can use this library.
